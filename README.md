# Python Design Workshop

This workshop will cover three intermediate design topics that will help you
improve your Python skills.

## Dependency Injection

Make your life easier by providing object to other objects rather than creating
them internally.

## Primitive Obsession

Make use of classes to create richer data structures.

## Strategy Pattern

Make function agnostic to the specific algorithm.
